7.Question 7
What is the city and state of the store which had the greatest increase in average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) from November to December?

8.Question 8
Compare the average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) of the store with the highest msa_income and the store with the lowest median msa_income (according to the msa_income field). In what city and state were these two stores, and which store had a higher average daily revenue?

9.Question 9
Divide the msa_income groups up so that msa_incomes between 1 and 20,000 are labeled 'low', msa_incomes between 20,001 and 30,000 are labeled 'med-low', msa_incomes between 30,001 and 40,000 are labeled 'med-high', and msa_incomes between 40,001 and 60,000 are labeled 'high'. Which of these groups has the highest average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) per store?


10.Question 10
Divide stores up so that stores with msa populations between 1 and 100,000 are labeled 'very small', stores with msa populations between 100,001 and 200,000 are labeled 'small', stores with msa populations between 200,001 and 500,000 are labeled 'med_small', stores with msa populations between 500,001 and 1,000,000 are labeled 'med_large', stores with msa populations between 1,000,001 and 5,000,000 are labeled “large”, and stores with msa_population greater than 5,000,000 are labeled “very large”. What is the average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) for a store in a “very large” population msa?


11.Question 11
Which department in which store had the greatest percent increase in average daily sales revenue from November to December, and what city and state was that store located in? Only examine departments whose total sales were at least $1,000 in both November and December.


12.Question 12
Which department within a particular store had the greatest decrease in average daily sales revenue from August to September, and in what city and state was that store located?


13.Question 13
Identify which department, in which city and state of what store, had the greatest DECREASE in the number of items sold from August to September. How many fewer items did that department sell in September compared to August?


14.Question 14
For each store, determine the month with the minimum average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) . For each of the twelve months of the year, count how many stores' minimum average daily revenue was in that month. During which month(s) did over 100 stores have their minimum average daily revenue?


15.Question 15
Write a query that determines the month in which each store had its maximum number of sku units returned. During which month did the greatest number of stores have their maximum number of sku units returned?
